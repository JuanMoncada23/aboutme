<h2>Introduction</h2> 
<p> My name is Juan Moncada and I'm 23 years old. I'm a first generation college student and soon to be college grad 
    this upcoming May. I enjoy hanging out with friends, working out, going on car cruises and eating food! I also enjoy reading 
    and playing video games. My family consists of me, my two sisters (Aleen & Carla), both my parents (Manuel & Juana) and our dog whose name is Sparky. My dad works in Romeville and my mom
    is a stay at home mom. I'm not sure what kind of dog Sparky is. My sister Aleen goes to Concordia University and Carla is a freshmen in high school. Aleen is majoring in pre-med and Carla wants to follow in the foot
    steps of Aleen. I'm majoring in Computer Science and hopefully find a job in software engineering or cyber security. I want to start my own software company one day 
    which is why I chose to major in computer science. Plus I love technology and coding has always catch my attention as I was growing up.

<h2>What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h2> 
<ul class="a"> 
    <li>Be a better programmer overall</li> 
    <li>Learn how to use debuggers</li> 
    <li>Learn how to cloud compute</li> 
    <li>Learn how to utilize scripting</li> 
</ul> 

<h2>My Favorite Hobby</h2> 
<p> My favorite hobby is to DJ. Music has always been a passion of mine growing up. I enjoy listening to all types of music such as jazz, country, rap, 
    blues, hip hop etc. I'm a huge Frank Sinatra fan which is shocking to a lot of people. My inspiration to DJ comes from my uncle. My uncle has been DJing for
    over 20 years now. I remember as a kid me tagging along with him to these parties he would DJ and just watching him have so much fun doing it and getting 
    paid to do is something that always stuck with me. Now I'm doing the samething as he is 20 years later and it's all thanks to him for inspiring me and
    motivating me to do and not give up. I have had the opportunity to DJ at house parties and just recently a fundraiser. I was able to show my skills off 
    to which I hope leads to more clients for me.

<h2>Greatest Innovation</h2> 
<ul class="b"> 
    <li>I consider <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/graphical-user-interface-gui" target="_blank">Graphical User Interface (GUI)</a> to be one of the greatest innovation because it allows us to interact with different
         electronic devices such as icons and windows.</li> 
    <li>I also consider <a href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/AboutGPS/" target="_blank">Global Positioning System (GPS)</a> to be another great inovation because without it I wouldn't be able to 
         get home or know which route to take when going to Texas.</li> 
    <li><a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/cell-phone.htm" target="_blank">Cell phones</a> are another great inovation because it allows us to stay connect with friends and family when we are on the go.</li>
</ul> 

<h2>Fun Fact</h2> 
<p> A fun fact about me is that I'm a shoe collector. I work at Nike and I've been working there for over four years now. Since I've been working there I have
    collected over 40 pairs of shoes and counting! I love shoes and everything about them. What really catches my attention is the history behind the shoes. 
    Just like a rock or tree a shoe has a story to tell. Specifically how the shoe was design and how it was design and why it has the name it does etc.
